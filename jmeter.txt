What is Software Testing ?
============================

=> Process of verfication and validation

=> Software Testing will happen in multiple ways

	1) Unit Testing  

	2) Smoke Testing

	3) Functionality Testing

	4) Regression Testing

	5) Performance Testing


# Unit Testing : Testing individual components of application (developers)

# Smoke Testing : Checking the main functionalities are working or not (build acceptance testing)

Note: If crucial functionalites are working then build will be accepted by testing team to proceed with next phase of testing.

# Functionality Testing : Testing all the functionalities are working as expected by the client or not. If any functionality not working then testers will raise defect/bug using JIRA.

# Regression Testing :  The process of testing the modified parts of the code and the parts that might get affected due to the modifications.

# Performance Testing : The process of testing application stability and responsiveness.

=> With the help of performance testing we will get answers for below questions

	1) How many users can access our application at a time

	2) What is avg response time of our application

	3) What is bottleneck/failure of our application

=> We can use JMETER to implement performance test on the application.

================
What is JMETER
================

=> Free and Open source software

=> Developed by using Java Language

=> Developed by Apache Org

=> Used for Performance testing

Creating Test Plan
====================

Step-1 : Right Click on Test plan & Add Thread Group

Step-2 : Right Click on Thread Group -> Add Sampler => Add HTTP Request

Step-3 : Configure API information in HTTP Request

Step-4 : Right Click on Thread Group -> Add Listeners

				- Summary Report

				- View Results Tree

Step-5 : Save Test Plan and execute it

Step-6 : Monitor View Results Tree & Summary Result
